This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```
npm run dev

```

This game takes in an array of bingo boards and the draw nums and returns the board which is the last to win and its score.
